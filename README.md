## Test-Taking Rules

1. You can't consult each other on-line or look at each others' repos.
2. However, you can use any other on-line references, especially all of my repos and all of your repos, like the repo for the midterm.

## Scoring

Each Part is a playground and is worth 4 points. There are 5 playgrounds total. So there are 20 pts total.

## Directions

It's a good idea to quit and restart Xcode when working on different parts and only work on one part at a time. Don't get bogged down on a part. If a part is taking you more than 15 minutes, move along.

During the test now and then it's also a good idea to do

    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Note to self about what you just accomplished."
    $ git push origin master

That way you won't lose much work if Xcode explodes.
